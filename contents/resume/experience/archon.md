I mentor and coordinate with a small team of developers and QA to deliver web-based tax collection software to municipalities. Our public facing product is [CivicSource&reg; Auctioneer](http://www.civicsource.com/), a website which facilitates auctions of delinquent taxes and property online. I came on board very early in the company's history and played a major role in architecting and building the software to its current state.

Developing this software has provided many interesting technological challenges:

* Helped to design and implement a scalable messaging infrastructure to split a web application and its database to run across multiple web servers.
* Implemented real-time bidding across multiple web servers under a very large traffic load using web sockets to create a highly-responsive and scalable web application.
* Able to work with a very large and growing codebase to implement new technologies ([single-page applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) in a way that keeps legacy systems running but allows new development to use the latest and greatest technologies. We use a number of client-side libraries to help in this process including [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) & [require.js](http://requirejs.org/).
