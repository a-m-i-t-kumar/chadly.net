## Running Locally

Run the following in a terminal:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

This will start the gatsby development server at `localhost:8000`.

### Webmentions

If you want to load webmentions while running locally, be sure to set the environment variable `WEBMENTIONS_TOKEN`. You can do that by creating a `.env` file with the contents:

```
WEBMENTIONS_TOKEN=my_token
```
