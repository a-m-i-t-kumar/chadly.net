# Personal Website

Built with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith).

##How to run

Note: you will need [bower](http://bower.io/) and [grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) installed to install and build web assets. Install them if you don't already have them.

From the project directory, install dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

Then build the web assets and preview the site:

```bash
grunt dev
wintersmith preview
```

Connect at 'localhost:8080'.
